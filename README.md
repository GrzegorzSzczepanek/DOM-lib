## ðŸ“œ To-Do List

### ðŸŸ¢ Basics: DOM Manipulation
1. **Create Elements**
   - [ ] Write a function to create a DOM element with attributes and children.
   - [ ] Support adding text nodes as children.
   - [ ] Handle nested elements.

2. **Append to the DOM**
   - [ ] Write a function to append an element to a parent.

3. **Remove Elements**
   - [ ] Add a method to remove an element from the DOM.

4. **Update Attributes**
   - [ ] Write a function to add, remove, or update attributes on an element.

5. **Classes Utility**
   - [ ] Add methods to manipulate CSS classes:

### ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate: Event Handling
6. **Add Event Listeners**
   - [ ] Implement a method to add event listeners to an element.

7. **Remove Event Listeners**
   - [ ] Allow removal of attached event listeners.

8. **Delegate Events**
   - [ ] Add support for event delegation to handle events on child elements.

---

### ðŸŸ  Advanced: Dynamic Rendering
9. **Render Elements from Object Structure**
   - [ ] Create a method to generate DOM elements from a JavaScript object.

10. **Clear DOM**
    - [ ] Add a function to clear all children of an element.

11. **Re-render Elements**
    - [ ] Implement a `rerender` function to update the DOM based on new data.

---

### ðŸ”µ Expert: Virtual DOM
12. **Virtual DOM Representation**
    - [ ] Create a virtual DOM structure as plain JavaScript objects.


13. **Diff Algorithm**
    - [ ] Write a function to compare two virtual DOM trees and return a list of differences.

14. **Patch DOM**
    - [ ] Use the diff results to update only the changed parts of the real DOM.

---

### ðŸ”´ Mastery: State Management and Optimization
15. **State Management**
    - [ ] Implement a simple state management system that triggers DOM updates.

16. **Lifecycle Hooks**
    - [ ] Add lifecycle hooks like `onMount` and `onDestroy` for elements.

17. **Batch Updates**
    - [ ] Optimize DOM updates by batching multiple changes into a single repaint.

---

### ðŸŸ£ Bonus: Utilities
18. **Query Selector Wrapper**
    - [ ] Add a method for easy element selection.

19. **CSS Styling**
    - [ ] Write a method to apply styles dynamically to an element.

20. **Animations**
    - [ ] Add basic animation utilities (e.g., fade in/out).

21. **Persistence**
    - [ ] Save and load the DOM structure to/from localStorage.

---

### ðŸ§ª Testing and Documentation
22. **Unit Tests**
    - [ ] Write tests for all utility functions.
    - [ ] Use a library like Jest or write your own minimal test runner.

23. **Documentation**
    - [ ] Write detailed usage instructions with examples.

24. **Bundle the Library**
    - [ ] Set up a build process (e.g., with Rollup or Webpack) to create a distributable library.
